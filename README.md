Program for automating and organizing planets in Starport GE (Space Video Game I play)

Literally wrote this to better organize my planets in a video game...

To properly use this your planetary naming systme must be (coordinates)CapitalFirstLetter-PlanetType in 3 letters Then planet number. (period) xxx (must be 3 things inbetween I'm using numbers on a unit circle but you can make this anything but i plan to use its location on a unit circle to have a bot fly to it in the future . (Then another period IF AND ONLY IF, its Zounds, Growing, Researching ,Needs Defense or is a Double dome, if its none of that forego this period)

So an example of a planetary name is (123, 321)Oce13.180.ZN (coordinates can be anywhere between 1 to 3 digits on the x and y coordinates so it can still be (23, 1) that is still okay if said coordinates exist in teh game

My planets will look like Panther(123, 321)Arc012.100.ZD

Its important to note you can have 000 to 999 planets maximum of that type I haven't accounted for anything more but you can represent your planet type as 2 digits or 3
so 010 is acceptable and 10 is acceptable

Table for stuff
Arc == Arctics
Des == Deserts (not desmond)
Ear == Earthlikes
Gre == Greenhouses
Mou == Mountains
Oce == Oceanics
Par == Paradises
Roc == Rockies
Vol == Volcanics

D == Double Dome
G == Growing
N == Needs Defense
R == Research
Z == Zounds
